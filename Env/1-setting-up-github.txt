#Terraform Files
Env/production folder houses the IaC files needed for this lab:
backend.tf
main.tf
output.tf
startup.sh
vars.tf


#Configure Terraform to utilize a Cloud Storage as a backend 
In Cloudshell run:
PROJECT_ID=$(gcloud config get-value project)
gsutil mb gs://${PROJECT_ID}-tfstate

  * Bonus enable versioning for best practise 
    gsutil versioning set on gs://${PROJECT_ID}-tfstate

#Replace the PROJECT_ID placeholder with the project ID in both the vars.tf and backend.tf files:

cd ~/[REPO]
sed -i s/PROJECT_ID/$PROJECT_ID/g environments/production/vars
sed -i s/PROJECT_ID/$PROJECT_ID/g environments/production/backend.tf
